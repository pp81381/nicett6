# nicett6

An asyncio based package to talk to a Nice TT6 control unit for tubular motors using the RS-232 protocol

The Nice TT6 control unit is used to control projector screens, garage doors, awnings and blinds.   It is white labelled by Screen Research as the MCS-N-12V-RS232 projector screen controller and by Beamax as the 11299 projector screen controller.

See [this document](https://www.niceforyou.com/sites/default/files/upload/manuals/IS0064A00MM.pdf) for the protocol definition

Known to work with a GANA USB to RS-232 DB9 cable on Windows 10 and on Raspbian Stretch

# Basic Control API

## Opening a connection

`open_connection([serial_port])`

Opens a connection to the TT6 controlled connected to `serial_port`

If `serial_port` is not supplied or is `None` then an intelligent guess will be made as to the right parameter depending on the platform

The serial_port parameter can be anything that can be passed to `serial.serial_for_url()`.  E.g.

* `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux)
* `COM3` (Windows)
* `socket://192.168.0.100:50000` (if you are using a TCP/IP to serial  converter)

Returns an async context managed `MultiPlexerSerialConnection`

Example:

```python
    async with open_connection(serial_port) as conn:
        tt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)
        writer = conn.get_writer()
        await writer.send_hex_move_command(tt_addr, 0xE0)
```

## MultiPlexerSerialConnection

A class that allows multiple readers and writers to a single serial connection.

Created by `open_connection([serial_port])`.   See [Opening a connection](#opening-a-connection).

Method|Description
--|--
`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.add_reader()`|Returns a new reader object.<br>If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Reader` object, derived from `MultiplexerReader`.<br>The serial connection retains a weak reference to the reader in order to keep it updated.  A reader that is no longer needed can either be dereferenced or explicitly removed.
`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.remove_reader(reader)`|Stops the `reader` object from receiving any further messages
`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.get_writer()`|Returns a new writer object.   If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Writer` object, derived from `MultiplexerWriter`.<br>The base class manages contention between multiple potential clients of the same connection.<br>Writer objects do not take any resources and can simply be dereferenced when finished with

## TTBusDeviceAddress

A simple class that represents the address of a TTBus device - to be used for `tt_addr` paramters

Supports comparison with other objects of the same class

Can be used as a key in a mapping type

Property|Description
--|--
`address`|the address of the device on the TTBus
`node`|the device node (usually 0x04)
`as_tuple`|a tuple of `(address, node)`

<br>

Example:

```python
tt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)
```

## TT6Reader

A reader that will collect all decoded messages received on the `MultiPlexerSerialConnection` in a queue until it is removed

A `TT6Reader` is an asynchronous iterator returning [response message objects](#Response-message-classes)

Usage:

```python
    async for msg in reader:
        # Do something with msg
```

Constructor parameters:

Parameter|Description
--|--
`name`|name of cover (for logging purposes)
`max_drop`|maximum drop of cover in metres

<br>
Example:

```python
cover = Cover("Screen", 2.0)
```

Property|Description
--|--
`Cover.drop_pct`|the percentage drop (0.0 = fully open/down, 1.0 = fully closed/up)
`Cover.drop`|drop in metres
`Cover.is_moving`|returns True if the cover has moved recently
`Cover.is_closed`|returns True if the cover is fully up (opposite of a blind)
`Cover.is_closing`|returns True if the cover is going up (opposite of a blind)<br>will only be meaningful after `drop_pct` has been set by the first POS message coming back from the cover for a movement
`Cover.is_opening`|returns True if the cover is going down (opposite of a blind)<br>will only be meaningful after `drop_pct` has been set by the first POS message coming back from the cover for a movement


Method|Description
--|--
`Cover.set_drop_pct`|Set the percentage drop (0.0 = fully open/down, 1.0 = fully closed/up) - async<br>Will notify observers of the state change
`Cover.moved()`|Called to indicate movement<br>When initiating movement, call `moved()` so that `is_moving` will be meaningful in the interval before the first POS message comes back from the cover<br>Will notify observers of the state change
`Cover.set_idle()`|Called to indicate that the cover is idle<br>After detecting that the cover is idle, call `set_idle()` so that the next movement direction will be correctly inferred<br>Will notify observers of the state change

Helper|Description
--|--
`wait_for_motion_to_complete(covers)`|Waits for motion of a list of covers to complete<br>Has side effect of notifying observers of the cover when it goes idle


## TT6Cover

Class that sends commands to a `Cover` that is connected to the TTBus

Intended to be constructed by `CoverManager.add_cover()`

Property|Description
--|--
`TT6Cover.tt_addr`|the TTBus address of the Cover
`TT6Cover.cover`|the `Cover` helper
`TT6Cover.writer`|the low level `TT6Writer`

Method|Description
--|--
`TT6Cover.send_pos_request()`|Send a POS request to the controller
`TT6Cover.send_drop_pct_command(drop_pct)`|Send a POS command to the controller to set the drop percentage of the Cover to `drop_pct`<br>`drop_pct` should be between 0.0 (fully open/down) and 1.0 (fully closed/up)<br>Out of range values for `drop_pct` will be rounded up/down accordingly

`TT6Cover.send_preset_command(preset_num)`|Send an preset command to the controller for the Cover
`TT6Cover.send_stop_command()`|Send a stop command to the controller for the Cover

## PostMovementNotifier

Helper class that resets a cover to idle after movement has stopped

Documented here for completeness but intended to be constructed by and internal to the `CoverManager`

Most state changes of a `Cover` will be triggered by the receipt of a POS message.  The `Cover` infers that there is movement when a message is received and infers the direction from the current and previous message.   However, there is no notification that the `Cover` is idle so the `PostMovementNotifier` class detects that there has been no movement for a period and then calls `Cover.set_idle()`.  The `Cover` will then notify its observers that it is idle.

The class implements the `AsyncObserver` interface and is intended to be attached to a `Cover`.  Whenever the `Cover` moves it calls `notifyObservers()` which calls `PostMovementNotifier.update()`.  A task is created that will wait for a period and then set the `Cover` to idle.   If a task was already running when the movement notification is received then the task will be cancelled and restarted.

The task must sleep for `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL + PostMovementNotifier.POST_MOVEMENT_ALLOWANCE` seconds without being cancelled for the `Cover` to be considered idle.

        {
            "address": 2,
            "node": 4,
            "name": "screen",
            "step_len": 0.01,

# Examples

The following examples can be used in conjunction with the [Emulator](#Emulator)

* `example1.py` - shows how to use the [High Level CIW API](#High-Level-CIW-API)
* `example2.py` - shows how to use the [Basic Control API](#Basic-Control-API)
* `example3.py` - shows how to use the [High Level Cover API](#High-Level-Cover-API)

# Utilities

## Movement Timing Logger

The script `movement_timing_logger.py` can be used to see how often the controller publishes POS messages as it moves.   It will move the specified Cover down and then back up and log the time between messages.   This can be used to tune `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL` so that `Cover.is_moving` is accurate.

```
usage: movement_timing_logger.py [-h] [-s SERIAL_PORT] [-a {2,3}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SERIAL_PORT, --serial_port SERIAL_PORT
                        serial port
  -a {2,3}, --address {2,3}
                        device address
```

# Notes

## End of Line (EOL) characters

The protocol definition specifies that all messages end in a carriage return character but in practice the controller seems to use carriage return plus line feed.

For convenience the API can handle either.

* The API will write to the controller with messages ending in carriage return
* The API will handle messages from the controller with either line ending
* The emulator will handle inbound commands with either line ending
* The emulator will send responses ending in carriage return and line feed

## Measurement units

This document refers to metres as the unit of measurement for all absolute measurements but you can use mm, cm, inches or feet as long as you are consistent
